# Project for "Wikishop"
The online store "Wikishop" is launching a new service. Now users can edit and supplement product descriptions, similar to how wikis work. That is, customers suggest their own edits and comment on changes made by others. The store needs a tool that will detect toxic comments and send them for moderation.

Train a model to classify comments as positive or negative. You have a dataset with labels indicating the toxicity of the edits.
